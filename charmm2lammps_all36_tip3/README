Parameter and topology files in this folder have been modified to include HT and OT atom types to account for tip3 water molecules. HT OT bond coefficients, HT OT HT angle coefficients, and LJ non bonded parameters have been added. They also contain topology and parameters for divalent DOPA (DO2P), iron and chloride ions (FE3P and CLA), DOPA, dityrosine crosslinks (DITY), and DOPA crosslinks (DOPX).
