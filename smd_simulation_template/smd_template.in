# Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulation Bis-Catechol Complex
# Using the CHARMM36 FF and CHARMM General Force Field

#### Setup

units           real 						# Set the style of units used for the simulation to real.
neigh_modify    every 1 delay 0 check yes 	# build a new neighbor list every 1 step after a delay of 0 steps.
boundary		p p p 						# Define shrink-wrapped boundaries in all directions to accommodate deformation, but prevent interactions across boundaries.

# Set styles.

atom_style      full 						# Set per-atom attributes associated with an atom to molecular and charge (q).
bond_style      harmonic 					# Compute bonded interactions using a harmonic formula.
angle_style     charmm 						# Compute angle interactions between triplets of atoms using the charmm angle style.
dihedral_style  charmm 						# Compute dihedral interactions between quadruplets of atoms using the charmm dihedral style.
improper_style  harmonic 					# Compute improper interactions between quadruplets of atoms using a harmonic improper potential.
pair_style      lj/charmm/coul/long 8 12 	# Compute LJ and Coulombic interactions with an additional shifting or switching function that ramps the energy and/or force smoothly to zero between the specificed inner and outer cutoffs.
pair_modify     mix arithmetic 				# As is standard for the CHARMM force field, use geometric mixing rules for epsilon and arithmetic mixing rules for sigma in LJ potential calculation.
kspace_style    ewald 1e-4 					# Use standard Ewald summation for calculating long-range Coulombic or long-range 1/r^6 interactions.
special_bonds   charmm 						# Set special bond interactions, which are those pairwise interactions to be computed between permanently bonded atoms, to 0, 0, and 0. This is the default for commonly used versions of the CHARMM force field.
