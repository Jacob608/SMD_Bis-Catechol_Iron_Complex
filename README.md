# Summary

This repository demonstrates how to create a PSF file from a PDB structure of the bis-catechol iron complex shown below before running a steered molecular dynamics simulation in LAMMPS to analyze its force-displacement response. The bis-catechol complex consists of two divalent DOPA residues with ionized alcohol oxygens coordinating with a trivalent iron cation. The model is simulated with the CHARMM36 pairwise additive force field. Parameters for divalent DOPA were obtained using CGenFF program version 4.0.
