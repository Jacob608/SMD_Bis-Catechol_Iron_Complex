# Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulation Bis-Catechol Iron Complex
# Using the CHARMM36 FF and CHARMM General Force Field

#### Setup

units           real 						# Set the style of units used for the simulation to real.
neigh_modify    every 1 delay 0 check yes 	# build a new neighbor list every 1 step after a delay of 0 steps.
boundary		s s s 						# Define shrink-wrapped boundaries in all directions to accommodate deformation, but prevent interactions across boundaries.

# Set styles.

atom_style      full 						# Sets per-atom attributes associated with an atom to molecular and charge (q).
bond_style      harmonic 					# Compute bonded interactions using a harmonic formula.
angle_style     charmm 						# Compute angle interactions between triplets of atoms using the charmm angle style.
dihedral_style  charmm 						# Compute dihedral interactions between quadruplets of atoms using the charmm dihedral style.
improper_style  harmonic 					# Compute improper interactions between quadruplets of atoms using a harmonic improper potential.
pair_style      lj/charmm/coul/long 8 12 	# Compute LJ and Coulombic interactions with an additional shifting or switching function that ramps the energy and/or force smoothly to zero between the specificed inner and outer cutoffs.
pair_modify     mix arithmetic 				# As is standard for the CHARMM force field, use geometric mixing rules for epsilon and arithmetic mixing rules for sigma in LJ potential calculation.
kspace_style    ewald 1e-4 					# standard Ewald summation for calculating long-range Coulombic or long-range 1/r^6 interactions.
special_bonds   charmm 						# Sets special bond interactions, which are those pairwise interactions to be computed between permanently bonded atoms, to 0, 0, and 0. This is the default for commonly used versions of the CHARMM force field.

#### Read Data File

read_data       ionized.data fix cmap crossterm CMAP 	# Read in a lammps data file. Header lines containing the string 'crossterm' will be passed to the fix. Section names containing the string 'CMAP' will be passed to the fix.

#### Perform Energy Minimization

thermo 50 																		# Compute and print thermodynamic info (temperature, energy, and pressure) on timesteps that are a multiple of N.
thermo_style 	custom etotal ke temp pe ebond eangle density vol fmax fnorm 	# Specify which keywords are printed on each thermodynamic step.

minimize		1.0e-5 1.0e-6 100 1000 											# Perform an energy minimization of the system, by iteratively adjusting atom coordinates.
write_restart 	minimized.restart 												# Write a binary restart file of the current state of the simulation.
write_data 		minimized.data 													# Write a data file in text format of the current state of the simulation.
